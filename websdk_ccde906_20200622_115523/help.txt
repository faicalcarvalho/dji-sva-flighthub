How to configurate APPID and APPKEY?
1. ssh to the server that FlightHub is installed, and enter to the installation directory (default is /opt/flighthub)
2. edit flighthub.cfg file, append two key-value pairs to the end:
export FHSDK_APPID=fhappid
export FHSDK_APPKEY=fhaddkey

3. execute "sudo ./start.sh all" to make the configuration effect.
